        <h2>Methods Of Rainwater Harvesting.</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The only thing that differs in the following methods is the scale of the system. They all follow the same
          principles but differ on aesthetics and actual water conservation effectiveness. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-7">
        <h4>RAIN BARRELS</h4>
        <p>This method is the most common and one that many people are familiar with. This involves installing a barrel
          at a gutter downspout to collect rainwater. The actual barrel may be a recycled barrel or a new commercially
          available rain barrel.</p>
        <h5>Pros:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> Easily implemented by anyone at any residence</li>
          <li> Barrels are readily available in your community or at various stores & websites</li>
          <li> Barrels don’t take up much space so they can fit into any situation</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Capacity is generally only 50 to 100 gallons</li>
          <li>Easily overflows and wastes collection opportunities</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-7">
        <h4>“DRY” SYSTEM</h4>
        <p>This method is a variation of a rain barrel set-up, but it involves a larger storage volume. Essentially, the
          collection pipe “drys” after each rain event since it empties directly into the top of the tank.</p>
        <h5>Pros:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Can store a large amount of rainwater</li>
          <li>Great for climates where rainfall happens with infrequent, larger storm events</li>
          <li>Can be inexpensive to implement</li>
          <li>Less complicated system so maintenance is easier</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The storage tank must be located next to your house</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-7 order-lg-1">
        <h4>“WET” SYSTEM</h4>
        <p>This method involves locating the collection pipes underground in order to connect multiple downspouts from
          different gutters. The rainwater will fill the underground piping and the water will rise in the vertical
          pipes until it spills into the tank. The downspouts and underground collection piping must have water-tight
          connections. The elevation of the tank inlet must be below the lowest gutter on the house.</p>
        <h5>Pros:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The ability to collect from your entire collection surface</li>
          <li>The ability to collect from multiple gutters and downspouts</li>
          <li>The tank can be located away from your house</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>More expensive to implement due to underground piping</li>
          <li>Sufficient difference between gutters and tank inlet must be available</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Rainwater Capture and Storage Tank Systems</h4>
        <p>Rainwater capture and storage tank systems collect rainfall from roofs and other impervious surfaces, storing
          it for later use. Storage tanks range in capacity from 5 gallons to 50,000 gallons, depending on water needs.
          Their main function is to store water for use during periods of limited rainfall. This stored water helps
          balance the supply-demand equation.</p>
        <p>A typical rainwater capture and storage system consists of a catchment surface, gutters, downspouts and
          piping, filtration, a storage tank, and a distribution method. The catchment surface sheds rainwater, while
          the gutters, downspouts and piping divert the rainwater to the storage tank. Many home systems use existing
          gutters and downspouts, requiring minimal tools and equipment for installation.</p>
        <p>Systems intended solely for surface landscape use will typically only require a roof washer and filter basket
          to keep leaves and debris clear of the tank. They also need to have screens over any other opening to prevent
          mosquitoes from entering the system. Garden hoses, pipes or drip irrigation systems are commonly used to move
          the water from the storage tanks to where it is needed.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-7 ">
        <h4>Raingardens</h4>
        <p>A raingarden is an artificial depression in the landscape that collects and stores stormwater runoff until it
          can infiltrate the soil. The soil stores the water for use by vegetation. The water may also move through the
          soil, recharging groundwater or surface water systems.</p>
        <p>Raingardens are not ponds. When correctly designed, water should not stand for more than a few hours after
          most storms. They are usually planted with native vegetation that is hardy and attractive</p>
        <p>Besides being functional, a raingarden can be a beautiful and creative addition to a new or existing
          landscape. Plants in a raingarden can give color to the landscape throughout the year. Raingardens can be
          designed for an individual yard or a neighborhood, providing a habitat for birds, butterflies and other
          insects, for example.</p>

        <h4>Soil Storage and Infiltration Systems</h4>
        <p>A soil storage and infiltration system collects rainfall runoff from the roofs of buildings. It then directs
          runoff underground, where it infiltrates into the soil. This system, which also provides water for vegetation
          and recharge, consists of the following: gutters and downspouts to collect roof runoff, a catch basin to
          capture
          trash and fine particles, underground trenches that store the water while it soaks slowly into the soil, and
          an
          observation port to aid in maintenance.</p>
        <p>When the trench is filled with water during a storm, excess water flows from the gutter and onto the ground
          surface. A soil storage and infiltration system decreases the volume of runoff, contains potential pollutants
          and increases the amount of water entering the ground to recharge our groundwater systems.</p>
        <p>A soil storage and infiltration system can be installed fairly easily at numerous homes and businesses. Most
          buildings already have gutters and downspouts. At many sites the storage and infiltration trench can be
          located
          relatively close to buildings. This system is typically not used in areas with expansive soils due to soil
          saturation and soil shifting issues.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It all starts with your ROOF SURFACE. Nearly all roof surfaces are fine for rainwater harvesting.</li>
          <li>Your gutters should have some sort of GUTTER PROTECTION SCREENING in order to keep large debris from
            entering the gutters.</li>
          <li>You can collect rainwater from any type and shape of GUTTER. You do not need a special gutter for
            harvesting
            rainwater.</li>
          <li>An additional filtration opportunity is with the installation of a RAIN HEAD (downspout filter) that
            allows
            for a bit of self-cleaning filtration options.</li>
          <li>A FIRST-FLUSH DIVERTER helps to prevent the first flush of contaminated rainwater from entering the tank.
          </li>
          <li>Another rainwater filtration opportunity is with a TANK SCREEN that is installed on the tank entry point.
            It
            also helps to keep mosquitoes and pests out.</li>
          <li>RAINWATER TANKS come in all sorts of sizes and materials. Click to learn more about all the various types
            of
            rainwater harvesting tanks available on the market.</li>
          <li>Install an INSECT PROOF FLAP VALVE on the end of the overflow pipe to keep mosquitoes and pests out.</li>
          <li>An AUTO-FILL SYSTEM can be installed to keep a minimum amount of water in the tank at all times. This is
            very important for rainwater tanks that are connected to automatic irrigation systems in order to prevent
            the
            pump from running dry.</li>
          <li>Select a PUMP SYSTEM to provide pressurized rainwater to distribute the rainwater easier or to connect to
            an
            inground irrigation system.</li>
          <li>Install an IRRIGATION FILTER inline after the pump in order to catch any large debris that may have gotten
            through the pump.</li>
          <li>A WATER LEVEL INDICATOR can be helpful with monitoring the water usage from the tank. Those are available
            in
            simple gauge tank options along with wireless digital options.</li>
